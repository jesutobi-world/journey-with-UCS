<h2>
THE SEVEN MEMBERS
</h2>
<pre>
  BTS has seven phenomenal members. Below are the pictures of the seven members: their official and stage names,
date of birth, hometowns, and position in the band. All members are citizens of South-Korea but hail from different parts
of the even though there are some with same hometowns.I should also chip in that BTS fans are referred to as ARMY.
All members have an individual net-woth of 20 million US Dollars.
<em><b>ARMY to BTS are the best things to ever happen to them.</b></em>

<h1>
SELF INTRODUCTION 
</h1>
<p>My name is Bada Jesutobi Dorcas, bonafide student of University of Ibadan. Getting into this prestigious institution was quiet difficult, but do you know what is more difficult? Sustaining the self-confidence I came in with by keep being at  the top. But, amongst all things I give God the glory. It's been quiet memorable and smooth. 
Also, I want to appreciate my beautiful lecturer: Dr Aderonke Busayo Sakpere. One of the many downside of coming to a Federal University to study a course as mine is the fact that will be little projects to boost the students' skill level. But with a God-sent woman as Dr Sakpere I have
the confidence that such won't happen. This shall be updated later as inspiration comes. Thanks for reading.
